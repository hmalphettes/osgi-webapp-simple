Port the test-jndi webapp of jetty-hightide into a self-contained OSGi bundle for the hightide-on-OSGi experiment.
When the context file is looked-up, we also mirror its location into ${jetty.contexts.home}
to use an overriding configuration outside of the bundle itself.

In other words: when the context is inside the bundle it is for development purpose.

The only difference between the original context file and the one in this port
is the location of the webapp as set in the 'war':
 <Set name="war"><SystemProperty name="jetty.home" default="."/>/webapps/test-jndi</Set>
     becomes:
 <Set name="war"><Property name="this.bundle.install"/>/web</Set>
